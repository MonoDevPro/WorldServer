# WorldServer Godot Client Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete Godot C# client for the WorldServer multiplayer game, following the architectural patterns outlined in the problem statement. The client implements a clean architecture with proper separation of concerns and reuses the existing Simulation.Domain and Simulation.Application projects.

## Architecture

### 1. Service Container (`Scripts/Infrastructure/ServiceContainer.cs`)
- Simple dependency injection container for managing service lifetimes
- Provides singleton registration and retrieval
- Enables clean dependency management throughout the client

### 2. Network Layer (`Scripts/Network/`)
- **IntentService**: Manages sending game intents to the server
- **PacketHandler**: Processes incoming snapshots from the server
- **IClientPacketSender**: Interface for packet transmission (with mock implementation)
- **ClientSnapshots**: Simplified snapshot classes for client use

### 3. ECS State Layer (`Scripts/State/`)
- **SnapshotApplySystem**: Applies server snapshots to the client ECS world
- Uses Arch ECS framework for state management
- Maintains player entities with components from Simulation.Domain
- Handles player join/leave, movement, and attack events

### 4. View Layer (`Scripts/Rendering/`)
- **PlayerView**: Renders individual player entities with smooth interpolation
- **PlayerViewManager**: Manages creation/destruction of player views based on ECS entities
- Automatically instantiates Player.tscn scenes for each player
- Provides visual distinction between local and remote players

### 5. Input Layer (`Scripts/Input/`)
- **InputHandler**: Captures player input (WASD movement, Space/Mouse attack)
- Converts Godot input events to game intents
- Includes input throttling to avoid server spam

### 6. Infrastructure (`Scripts/Infrastructure/`)
- **ClientEventBus**: Local event bus for decoupled communication
- **GodotLogger**: Logger implementation that outputs to Godot console
- **Demo**: Demonstration script showing architecture features

## Key Features

### ECS Integration
- Reuses Components from `Simulation.Domain` (Position, Direction, CharId, etc.)
- Maintains consistent state representation between client and server
- Efficient entity management with Arch framework

### Clean Architecture
- Clear separation between network, state, rendering, and input layers
- Dependency injection for testability and maintainability
- Event-driven communication between components

### Mock Networking
- Functional mock implementation for testing without server
- Easy to replace with real networking when dependencies are available
- Demonstrates full data flow from input to rendering

### Smooth Rendering
- Interpolated movement for smooth player motion
- Real-time position updates from ECS entities
- Visual feedback for local vs remote players

## Usage

1. **Build**: The project compiles successfully with `dotnet build`
2. **Connect**: Click "Connect to Server" to simulate connection
3. **Test**: Click "Test Player Join" to simulate server responses
4. **Controls**: Use WASD for movement, Space or Mouse for attack

## Integration with Real Server

To integrate with the actual WorldServer:

1. Replace `MockPacketSender` with real LiteNetLib implementation
2. Add proper packet serialization/deserialization
3. Connect to the server's network layer using `ClientNetworkApp`
4. Handle connection events and error scenarios

The implementation successfully demonstrates the requested architecture and provides a solid foundation for a multiplayer Godot client that can communicate with the WorldServer backend.
